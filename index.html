        Understanding fitting and bolt sizes is crucial knowledge. When it comes to fittings, you need to know about elbows, tees, and measurements in both inches and millimeters. Familiarity with thread standards like NPT, metric, BSP, and JIC is key. Material compatibility matters too, whether it's stainless steel, brass, or PVC. Switching to bolts, attention to diameter, length, pitch, head types, and strength grades is vital for choosing the right ones. </p>
